# 🤖 ECE/IEEE Summer Workshop: An Intro to Robotics

Welcome to the self-paced robotics workshop using the 4WD Arduino-powered robot platform.  
This site will guide you step-by-step through building and programming your own smart robot!

## 🌟 Introduction to Robotics

Robotics combines engineering, electronics, and programming to bring machines to life. Robots are all around us — in manufacturing, healthcare, delivery systems, and even space! In this workshop, you’ll learn **how to build and control your very own robot** using simple, powerful tools.

You’ll be working with a **4-wheel drive robot** powered by **Arduino**. Arduino is a beginner-friendly microcontroller that lets you write code to control hardware — motors, sensors, lights, and more. The goal is to make your robot drive, sense the environment, react, and display information — just like a real smart machine.

This hands-on learning experience will introduce you to key robotics concepts and core programming skills, even if you’ve never coded before.

## 🚗 About the Robot

Your robot uses:
- **Two DC motors** to drive the left and right sides
- An **L298P motor driver** to control motor speed and direction
- A **servo motor** to rotate sensors or displays
- An **ultrasonic sensor** to detect objects in front of it
- A **LED matrix** to show faces or messages

All of this is controlled by an **Arduino board** running your code.

> 💡 Throughout the workshop, you’ll learn how each component works, how to wire it up, and how to write programs that bring your robot to life!
