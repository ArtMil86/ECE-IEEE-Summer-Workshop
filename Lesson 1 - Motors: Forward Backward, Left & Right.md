# ðŸ“˜ Lesson 1 - Motors: Forward, Backward, Left & Right

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- Understand how to control motor **direction** using digital pins.
- Learn how to use **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)** to control motor **speed**.
- Practice Arduino code that allows the robot to move **forward**, **backward**, and **turn left/right**.

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts

- Each motor has two direction pins (`motorA1`, `motorA2`).
- Speed is controlled via `analogWrite()` on a **PWM-enabled pin** (like `speedPinA`).
- Combining the correct logic levels allows us to control motion patterns.

## ðŸ”Œ Wiring

| Motor | Direction Pin 1 | Direction Pin 2 | PWM Speed Pin |
|-------|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| A     | Pin 2           | Pin 3           | Pin 5         |
| B     | Pin 4           | Pin 7           | Pin 6         |

Make sure to connect the motor driver to the appropriate pins and that the PWM pins support `analogWrite()`.
